Early concept for a symmetric belt-driven extruder carriage for
upgrading Prusa Mendel. Belt-driven means there's no stepper motor on
the X-carriage, so it can be much lighter and move much faster.

It has two X-belts that are controlled by one stepper on each side.

If both belts move in the same direction, the X-carriage moves in that
direction too. If both belts move in opposite directions, the extruder
moves but the X-carriage stands still.

x_motion = (stepper1 + stepper2) / 2
extruder = (stepper1 - stepper2) / 2

We'll need new firmware to control x_motion and extruder independently
by setting the correct speed for each stepper motor for the two belts.

stepper1 = x_motion + extruder
stepper2 = x_motion - extruder
